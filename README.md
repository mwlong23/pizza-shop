## Specifications
Pizza Shop allows a user to select a pizza size, sauce and up to 2 toppings at no additional charge.

Pesto and Alfredo sauce cost an extra $3 and each additional topping (greater than two) costs $2.50. Pizzas cost $1 for each inch in diameter (ex: 14 inch pizza costs $14).

Once the user has built their pizza they can choose their order to a shopping cart or start over.  Starting over resets the page and allows the user to start a new order from scratch.

Once the order is added to cart a summary drops down with the size of pizza, sauce and toppings, along with the price and tax. Inside the summary menu are two buttons, one to submit the order and another to add an additional pizza to the order.

If the user chooses to add an additional pizza to the order the toppings, size and sauce menu reappears. The user can add as many pizzas to the order as desired and the order summary will be updated as they do so.
